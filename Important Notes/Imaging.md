#### Digital imaging is the process of capturing, storing, and manipulating images as digital data. Digital images are made up of pixels, which are assigned values that determine the color and brightness of the image. <br>
### How digital imaging works <br>
An image sensor captures light or other waves that reflect off objects. 
The sensor converts the light or waves into digital signals. 
A computer processes the signals into a digital image. 
The computer stores the image as a sequence of binary digits, or "bits". 
When needed, the computer reads the bits and interprets them as an analog image that can be displayed or printed. 
#### Uses of digital imaging <br>
Medicine: Digital imaging is used in CAT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, X-rays, and other medical imaging techniques. <br>
Manufacturing: Digital imaging is used in industrial and manufacturing applications. <br>
Photography: Digital cameras capture images that are stored as digital data. <br>
#### Benefits of digital imaging <br>
Digital images can be copied without loss of quality. 
Digital images can be enhanced to make them easier to interpret. 
Digital images can be analyzed to locate and measure objects within the image. 


### Wikipedia <br>
Digital imaging or digital image acquisition is the creation of a digital representation of the visual characteristics of an object,[1] such as a physical scene or the interior structure of an object. The term is often assumed to imply or include the processing, compression, storage, printing and display of such images. A key advantage of a digital image, versus an analog image such as a film photograph, is the ability to digitally propagate copies of the original subject indefinitely without any loss of image quality.

Digital imaging can be classified by the type of electromagnetic radiation or other waves whose variable attenuation, as they pass through or reflect off objects, conveys the information that constitutes the image. In all classes of digital imaging, the information is converted by image sensors into digital signals that are processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image. For example, the medium of visible light allows digital photography (including digital videography) with various kinds of digital cameras (including digital video cameras). X-rays allow digital X-ray imaging (digital radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT), and gamma rays allow digital gamma ray imaging (digital scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET). Sound allows ultrasonography (such as medical ultrasonography) and sonar, and radio waves allow radar. Digital imaging lends itself well to image analysis by software, as well as to image editing (including image manipulation).

#### Digital Imaging
Originally published in 1986
Digital Imaging is the computer processed numerical representation of physical images. Enhancement of images results in easier interpretation. Quantitative digital image analysis by Perceptive Scientific Instruments, locates objects within an image and measures them to extract quantitative information. Applications are CAT scanners, radiography, microscopy in medicine as well as various industrial and manufacturing uses. The PSICOM 327 performs all digital image analysis functions. It is based on Jet Propulsion Laboratory technology, is accurate and cost efficient.

#### What is the meaning of scintigraphy? <br>
(sin-TIH-gruh-fee) A procedure that produces pictures (scans) of structures inside the body, including areas where there are cancer cells. Scintigraphy is used to diagnose, stage, and monitor disease. <br>
#### SPECT - <br>
A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan is a nuclear medicine imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer to create 3D images of the inside of the body.  <br>
Single-photon emission computed tomography
Medical imaging
Single-photon emission computed tomography is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique using gamma rays. It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a gamma camera, but is able to provide true 3D information.

#### Fluoroscopy <br>
Medical imaging
Fluoroscopy is a study of moving body structures--similar to an X-ray "movie." A continuous X-ray beam is passed through the body part being examined. The beam is transmitted to a TV-like monitor so that the body part and its motion can be seen in detail.

#### PET <br>
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans produce detailed 3-dimensional images of the inside of the body. The images can clearly show the part of the body being investigated, including any abnormal areas, and can highlight how well certain functions of the body are working.
 
### Gamma Ray Imaging <br>
Gamma-ray imaging is a technique that uses gamma rays to create images and detect radioactive materials. It's used in many fields, including medicine, nuclear engineering, and astrophysics. 
##### How it works <br>
A gamma camera detects gamma rays from radioactive atoms in the body.
The gamma rays pass through a collimator, which is a set of metal tubes.<br>
The gamma rays hit a scintillation crystal, which converts them into light.<br>
The camera amplifies and processes the light to create an image.
##### Uses <br>
Medicine<br>
Doctors use gamma cameras to diagnose diseases, monitor heart function, and image other physiological processes. 
Nuclear engineering
Gamma-ray imaging is used in nuclear security and safety to detect, localize, and characterize nuclear materials. 
Geologic survey <br>
Gamma-ray imaging can be used to map and estimate the activity of radiological source distributions. 
Other applications Contamination assessment, Decontamination and remediation verification, Nuclear facility decommissioning, Radiation safety/protection, and Nuclear security. 
#### Gamma Camera <br>
The Nuclear Camera (or otherwise known as a gamma camera) uses special imaging techniques called planar dynamic or single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) to detect radioactive energy that is emitted from the patient’s body and convert it into an image. The gamma camera itself does not emit any radiation. It is composed of radiation detectors, called gamma camera heads, which are encased in metal and plastic and most often shaped like a box, attached to a round circular donut shaped gantry.

The radioactive energy emitting from the patient’s body is the result of the introduction of a radioactive material called a radiopharmaceutical or radiotracer into the body. This material is either injected into the bloodstream, swallowed or inhaled as a gas. The material accumulates in the area of your body under examination, where it gives off a small amount of energy in the form of gamma rays. The gamma camera detects this energy and, with the help of a computer, create pictures that offer details on the structure and function of organs and tissues.
