#### Digital imaging is the process of capturing, storing, and manipulating images as digital data. Digital images are made up of pixels, which are assigned values that determine the color and brightness of the image. 
How digital imaging works
An image sensor captures light or other waves that reflect off objects. 
The sensor converts the light or waves into digital signals. 
A computer processes the signals into a digital image. 
The computer stores the image as a sequence of binary digits, or "bits". 
When needed, the computer reads the bits and interprets them as an analog image that can be displayed or printed. 
Uses of digital imaging
Medicine: Digital imaging is used in CAT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, X-rays, and other medical imaging techniques. 
Manufacturing: Digital imaging is used in industrial and manufacturing applications. 
Photography: Digital cameras capture images that are stored as digital data. 
Benefits of digital imaging
Digital images can be copied without loss of quality. 
Digital images can be enhanced to make them easier to interpret. 
Digital images can be analyzed to locate and measure objects within the image. 


### Wikipedia 
Digital imaging or digital image acquisition is the creation of a digital representation of the visual characteristics of an object,[1] such as a physical scene or the interior structure of an object. The term is often assumed to imply or include the processing, compression, storage, printing and display of such images. A key advantage of a digital image, versus an analog image such as a film photograph, is the ability to digitally propagate copies of the original subject indefinitely without any loss of image quality.

Digital imaging can be classified by the type of electromagnetic radiation or other waves whose variable attenuation, as they pass through or reflect off objects, conveys the information that constitutes the image. In all classes of digital imaging, the information is converted by image sensors into digital signals that are processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image. For example, the medium of visible light allows digital photography (including digital videography) with various kinds of digital cameras (including digital video cameras). X-rays allow digital X-ray imaging (digital radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT), and gamma rays allow digital gamma ray imaging (digital scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET). Sound allows ultrasonography (such as medical ultrasonography) and sonar, and radio waves allow radar. Digital imaging lends itself well to image analysis by software, as well as to image editing (including image manipulation).

#### Digital Imaging
Originally published in 1986
Digital Imaging is the computer processed numerical representation of physical images. Enhancement of images results in easier interpretation. Quantitative digital image analysis by Perceptive Scientific Instruments, locates objects within an image and measures them to extract quantitative information. Applications are CAT scanners, radiography, microscopy in medicine as well as various industrial and manufacturing uses. The PSICOM 327 performs all digital image analysis functions. It is based on Jet Propulsion Laboratory technology, is accurate and cost efficient.
