# Medical Imaging: CT, CAT, and PET Scans

CT scans (computed tomography scans), CAT scans, and PET scans (positron emission tomography scans) are all imaging technologies that produce pictures of the inside of the body. They each have different strengths and are used to diagnose a variety of conditions.  

## CT Scans  
- Use X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the body.  
- Can detect abnormal growths, injuries, and changes in organ size or structure.  
- Can be performed quickly, making them useful in emergencies.  
- No residual radiation remains in the body after the procedure.  

## PET Scans  
- Use a radioactive tracer to show how organs are functioning in real time.  
- Can detect cancer earlier than other tests.  
- Can detect cellular changes in organs and tissues.  
- A small amount of radiation may remain in the body for a short time after the scan.  

## PET/CT Scans  
- Combine the strengths of CT and PET scans into a single scan.  
- Can produce 3D images that allow for a more accurate diagnosis.  
- Can be used to detect cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological conditions.  

The type of imaging used depends on the specific clinical needs.  


### PET Scan vs. CT Scan

#### A CT scan uses X-rays to create images of organs, bones, and tissues, while a PET scan uses a radioactive tracer to show how organs function. Both are common and important imaging tools used to diagnose and monitor health conditions.
