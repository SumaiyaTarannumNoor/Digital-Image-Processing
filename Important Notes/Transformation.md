# Log Transformation 
Log transformation of gives actual information by enhancing the image. If we apply this method in an image having higher pixel values then it will enhance the image more and actual information of the image will be lost. So, this method canâ€™t be applied everywhere. It can be applied in images where low pixel values are more than higher ones.

# Gamma Transformation / Power-Law Transformation 
Gamma transformation" refers to a non-linear operation that adjusts the brightness and contrast of an image by raising each pixel value to a power, known as the "gamma" value, effectively altering the tonal curve of the image, making it appear brighter or darker depending on the gamma setting; it's commonly used to compensate for the non-linear response of display devices like monitors and to achieve a visually pleasing appearance on different screens.
