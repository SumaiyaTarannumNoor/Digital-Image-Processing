# Image Acquisition Using a Sensor Array

"Image acquisition using a sensor array" refers to the process of capturing an image by utilizing a grid of individual sensors. Each sensor within the array detects the intensity of light at a specific location, effectively creating a complete 2D image by combining the data from all the sensors simultaneously. This is the primary method used in most digital cameras and imaging devices today.
