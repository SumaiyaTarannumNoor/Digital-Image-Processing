# Image Acquisition Using a Sensor Array

"Image acquisition using a sensor array" refers to the process of capturing an image by utilizing a grid of individual sensors. Each sensor within the array detects the intensity of light at a specific location, effectively creating a complete 2D image by combining the data from all the sensors simultaneously. This is the primary method used in most digital cameras and imaging devices today.
# Image Sampling and Quantization

Image sampling and quantization are processes that convert continuous images into digital images. They are fundamental steps in digital image processing.  

## Sampling  
- The process of selecting specific points from a continuous image to create a discrete image.  
- Determines the spatial resolution of an image, or how finely it is divided into pixels.  
- The sampling rate determines the quality of the digitized image.  

## Quantization  
- The process of converting a continuous range of pixel values into a limited set of discrete values.  
- Determines the color or intensity resolution of an image, or the number of distinct colors or shades that can be represented.  
- The quantization level determines the number of grey levels in the digitized image.
# Digital Image Representation  

A digital image is represented as a grid of pixels, where each pixel is made up of a series of numbers, or bits. The numbers determine the color and brightness of each pixel.  

## How Digital Images Are Represented  

### Pixels  
- The basic unit of measurement for a digital image.  
- Each pixel represents a single color.  

### Coordinate System  
- The position of each pixel is identified by its location within a coordinate grid.  

### Color  
- Colors are represented in hex, RGB, and other identification schemes.  

### Color Depth  
- The number of bits used to represent color in an image.  
- Higher color depths allow for more vibrant images but require more storage space.  

### Image Formats  
- **TIFF** is the de facto standard format for archival digital image files.  
- **PNG** and **JPEG 2000** are other formats that can preserve data integrity and provide efficient compression ratios.  

### Image Types  
- Binary  
- Gray-scale  
- Color  
- Multispectral
