# Image Acquisition Using a Sensor Array

"Image acquisition using a sensor array" refers to the process of capturing an image by utilizing a grid of individual sensors. Each sensor within the array detects the intensity of light at a specific location, effectively creating a complete 2D image by combining the data from all the sensors simultaneously. This is the primary method used in most digital cameras and imaging devices today.
# Image Sampling and Quantization

Image sampling and quantization are processes that convert continuous images into digital images. They are fundamental steps in digital image processing.  

## Sampling  
- The process of selecting specific points from a continuous image to create a discrete image.  
- Determines the spatial resolution of an image, or how finely it is divided into pixels.  
- The sampling rate determines the quality of the digitized image.  

## Quantization  
- The process of converting a continuous range of pixel values into a limited set of discrete values.  
- Determines the color or intensity resolution of an image, or the number of distinct colors or shades that can be represented.  
- The quantization level determines the number of grey levels in the digitized image.
# Digital Image Representation  

A digital image is represented as a grid of pixels, where each pixel is made up of a series of numbers, or bits. The numbers determine the color and brightness of each pixel.  

## How Digital Images Are Represented  

### Pixels  
- The basic unit of measurement for a digital image.  
- Each pixel represents a single color.  

### Coordinate System  
- The position of each pixel is identified by its location within a coordinate grid.  

### Color  
- Colors are represented in hex, RGB, and other identification schemes.  

### Color Depth  
- The number of bits used to represent color in an image.  
- Higher color depths allow for more vibrant images but require more storage space.  

### Image Formats  
- TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a file format for storing raster graphics images.
- **TIFF** is the de facto standard format for archival digital image files.  
- **PNG** and **JPEG 2000** are other formats that can preserve data integrity and provide efficient compression ratios.  

### Image Types  
- Binary  
- Gray-scale  
- Color  
- Multispectral

# Gray Level Resolution and False Contouring  

A lower gray level resolution in an image results in a visible **false contouring** effect, where smooth areas of an image appear with artificial, step-like boundaries. This occurs due to the limited number of gray levels available to represent subtle intensity changes, making the image appear less detailed and potentially inaccurate for analysis, especially in areas with gradual intensity gradients.  

Conversely, **higher gray level resolution** allows for a more precise representation of fine details in an image, with smoother transitions between different intensity levels.
