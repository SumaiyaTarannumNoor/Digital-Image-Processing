# Image Acquisition Using a Sensor Array

"Image acquisition using a sensor array" refers to the process of capturing an image by utilizing a grid of individual sensors. Each sensor within the array detects the intensity of light at a specific location, effectively creating a complete 2D image by combining the data from all the sensors simultaneously. This is the primary method used in most digital cameras and imaging devices today.
# Image Sampling and Quantization

Image sampling and quantization are processes that convert continuous images into digital images. They are fundamental steps in digital image processing.  

## Sampling  
- The process of selecting specific points from a continuous image to create a discrete image.  
- Determines the spatial resolution of an image, or how finely it is divided into pixels.  
- The sampling rate determines the quality of the digitized image.  

## Quantization  
- The process of converting a continuous range of pixel values into a limited set of discrete values.  
- Determines the color or intensity resolution of an image, or the number of distinct colors or shades that can be represented.  
- The quantization level determines the number of grey levels in the digitized image.
