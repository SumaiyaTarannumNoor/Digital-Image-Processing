# Histogram Equalisation and Histogram Normalisation are different 
"histogram equalization" is a specific technique that aims to spread out the intensity values in an image to create a more uniform histogram, while "histogram normalization" simply means scaling the values in a histogram so that they sum up to 1 (or 100%), essentially converting the counts into probabilities; essentially, normalization is a step often used within the process of histogram equalization but not the entire operation itself.
