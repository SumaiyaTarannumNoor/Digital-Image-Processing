## Electromagnetic Spectrum to Inage creation
#### - The electromagnetic spectrum is used to create images by capturing different wavelengths of radiation across the spectrum, with various imaging technologies utilizing specific portions of this spectrum to visualize different aspects of an object or scene, such as visible light photography for everyday images, infrared for heat detection, and X-rays for medical imaging; essentially, different parts of the spectrum provide unique information about an object's properties when captured and interpreted as an image. 
#### - To create an image using the electromagnetic spectrum, different wavelengths of radiation across the spectrum are captured by specialized sensors, then assigned colors based on their position on the spectrum, allowing for the visualization of data that might not be visible to the naked eye, like infrared heat or X-ray bone structures, by combining these data points into a composite image on a screen; essentially, different parts of the spectrum are translated into color variations on an image, with visible light being the most common example where red, green, and blue wavelengths are used to create color images.
