Lossless compression techniques preserve all original data, allowing perfect reconstruction of the original file after decompression. Commonly used techniques include LZW, Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Deflate, and more. These methods are often used for files where exact data preservation is crucial, such as text documents, databases, and certain image formats. 
Here's a more detailed look at some key lossless compression techniques:
1. Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW):
What it is:
LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that finds repeating sequences of characters in the data and replaces them with codes.
How it works:
A dictionary is built during compression, and as it finds repeating sequences, it assigns them codes.
Where it's used:
LZW is commonly used in image formats like GIF and TIFF, as well as in some text compression algorithms.
Example:
Imagine a text document with the phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps..." LZW would identify the repeated phrase "The quick brown fox jumps" and assign it a code, replacing the entire phrase with the shorter code. 
2. Huffman Coding:
What it is:
A variable-length coding scheme that assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring data elements and longer codes to less frequent ones.
How it works:
Huffman coding builds a tree structure where more frequent characters have shorter paths, and less frequent characters have longer paths.
Where it's used:
Huffman coding is used in ZIP file formats and other compression algorithms like Deflate.
Example:
In the example above, LZW would identify "e" as a frequently occurring character and assign it a shorter code than a less frequent character like "x". 
3. Run-Length Encoding (RLE):
What it is:
A simple lossless compression technique that replaces long sequences of the same data element with a count and the value.
How it works:
RLE looks for consecutive runs of the same character or pixel value and replaces them with a count of the run length followed by the value.
Where it's used:
RLE is often used in bitmap images, where large areas of the same color can be efficiently compressed.
Example:
If an image has a large block of white pixels, RLE could replace the entire block with a count of the number of white pixels followed by the value "white". 
4. Deflate:
What it is: A combined compression algorithm that uses both LZ77 and Huffman coding.
How it works: Deflate uses LZ77 to find repeating strings of data and replace them with pointers to the original string, and Huffman coding to further compress the output.
Where it's used: Deflate is used in formats like ZIP and PNG.
Example: Deflate combines the dictionary-based approach of LZ77 with the frequency-based approach of Huffman coding, making it a powerful compression algorithm. 
5. Bzip2:
What it is:
A lossless compression algorithm that uses a combination of Burrows-Wheeler transform and Huffman coding.
How it works:
Bzip2 is a sophisticated algorithm that provides high compression ratios.
Where it's used:
Bzip2 is often used for compressing files, especially those with a high degree of redundancy.
Example:
Bzip2 can be used to compress large text files, data archives, and other types of data. 
In summary, lossless compression algorithms ensure that no data is lost during the compression process, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction of the original data. These techniques are crucial in applications where data integrity is paramount, such as archiving, medical imaging, and scientific research.
