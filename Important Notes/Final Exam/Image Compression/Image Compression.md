# Image Compression

**Image compression** is a process that reduces the size of digital image files, either by maintaining or sacrificing some image quality, to save storage space or bandwidth. It uses various algorithms to encode image data more efficiently.

This process is essential for web page performance, mobile image sharing, and storage optimization.

## Key Aspects of Image Compression

### Purpose
- Reduce file size for storage, transmission, and faster loading times.

### Methods
Image compression algorithms fall into two broad categories:

#### Lossless Compression
- Preserves all original image data.
- Results in no quality loss.
- Typically results in larger file sizes compared to lossy methods.
  
#### Lossy Compression
- Discards less important data.
- Significantly reduces file size.
- May lead to noticeable quality degradation.
- **JPEG** is a common example of lossy compression.

## Applications
- Web image optimization
- Image sharing on social media
- Mobile phone photography
- Email attachments and backups

---

## Benefits
- Faster web page loading
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Efficient use of storage

---

## Trade-Offs
- The level of compression must be balanced with image quality.
- Over-compression can cause visible artifacts and degradation.

## Example
Imagine taking a high-resolution photo on your smartphone. To share it quickly on a messaging app or upload it to a website, you might compress the image. This would significantly reduce the file size, making transmission fasterâ€”though it might slightly reduce visual quality.
